# git_test
The Odin Project told me to create a `git_test` repository that I can use for learning `git` and `github`. 
```Java
//I just want to add some information here to test if this change, below, will commit.
public class Test{

    public static void main(Strings[] args){

        //This should be the basic Hello World tutorial used in if not all programming languages.

        System.out.println("Git Test using Java");
        
    }
}
//I am done let me see if this will commit
```
